## Conference System Program
_This program creates a system allowing users to login in and according to their account type, schedule for events, message other users and present personalized schedules, whilst implementing design rules from Clean Architecture._

#### How this program works.
The user is first asked to either sign up or log in to their account. When signing up they have the choice of 3 different user types; Organizer, Speaker and Attendee. When logging into the account the user is prompted to give their username and password, if they are inputted incorrectly pr if they do not exist. The user will be taken back to the starting menu.

Once they have logged in, depending on their role in the program, they will be presented with different menus, allowing different actions.
All users can;
            
            [1] Log out
            [2] Send a message
            [3] View all messages
            [4] Add a contact
            [5] View all contacts
            
Option 1 allows them to log out, saving the information they have created in a corresponding csv file, which will be then loaded. If user does not log out, their information will not be stored.
Option 2 allows them to send a message. The recipients of the messages will differ for each user. We will elaborate in later sections.
Option 3 allows users to see all the messages that have been sent, categorized by users.
Option 4 allows users to add any contact they want.
Option 5 allows users to view all the contacts they have already added.
            
If they are an;

Option 6 allows organizers to create an event, and in doing so, allows them to create a new room, and/or adding a new speaker.
- they can also use existing speakers and rooms. 
- This option checks if speakers are double-booked or if the room is double-booked

Option 9 allows organizers to add a room without creating an event
Option 10 allows organizers to create a speaker without creating an event
